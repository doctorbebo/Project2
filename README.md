# Project2

This Projects main purpose is to expose us to bootstrap. It's important to learn specific tools important to the industry of wed development. 
However, as Brian pointed out last week, it's important to not lean too much on tools such as bootstrap. This project really helped solidify 
bootstraps purpose and effectiveness. 

I found this assignment to be a little bit easier than project one because these assignments were similar at their base. I found my main
frustration being unable to completely understand what bootstrap was implementing which caused difficulty fixing bugs within 
bootstrap code. 

I learned several things within this assignment. Mostly I learned how to implement Bootstrap. I also feel a lot more comfortable the 
box model and its application within web development. Furthermore, I learned more about "div" tags or tags in general and how to apply
multiple classes and id to a single tag. The value of indentation is even more solidified in my mind, because importing and understanding
code from bootstrap was easier than expected. One issue I never solved completely was aligning nav bar elements to the right with bootstrap. 
I had to solve that issue with my own CSS code. Finally, I learned how to use git bash to created branches and assess certain branches within
Git.

Tools I used a couple common tools in development of this project. I had three html files that were supported by bootstrap CSS as well as an original CSS file. 
I also imported three java script files from bootstrap in order to get the drop down nav bar to work correctly. Visual Studio Code is what I used to write my code.
Git was my source control and Git Bash is what I used to access my source code.
